    "# What is PRIMM?\n",
    "\n",
    "Do your students find programming difficult? Are they staring blankly at a blank editor window not knowing where to start? Well they are not alone. Research has shown that many students find it difficult to write a program from scratch. As an educator, you probably use a variety of techniques to help them, presumably some of the strategies that helped you yourself to learn to program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PRIMM** is an approach to planning programming lessons and activities and includes the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Predict**\n",
    "- **Run**\n",
    "- **Investigate**\n",
    "- **Modify**\n",
    "- **Make**\n",
    "\n",
    "These stages are used in planning lessons and activities and are designed to support learners at all stages of learning programming in school, not just complete beginners.\n",
    "\n",
